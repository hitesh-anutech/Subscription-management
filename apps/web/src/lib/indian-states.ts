/**
 * Canonical Indian states / UTs with their GST state codes.
 *
 * `name` matches Zoho Books' accepted state names exactly so that, when a lead is
 * pushed as a Zoho customer, Zoho resolves GST place-of-supply correctly (free-text
 * typos like "Maharastra" silently fall back to the org default → wrong tax).
 * `code` is the 2-digit GST state code (e.g. 27 = Maharashtra, 07 = Delhi).
 *
 * National GST standard — fixed, so safe to hardcode (no Zoho API call).
